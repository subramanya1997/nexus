### Reasoning:
- 403 error indicates authentication/authorization issue
- Customer explicitly states this is blocking their team
- Enterprise customer (Big Client Inc) - high priority account
- Issue appeared suddenly without customer changes - likely our side

### Summary for Agent:
Enterprise customer experiencing 403 Forbidden on dashboard access. Blocking issue, no recent changes on their end. Likely permission/auth service issue. Check recent deployments and auth service status.`

  if (!token) {

### 🔴 Security Issues (2)

1. **JWT Secret Handling** (High)
   \`\`\`typescript
   // Current - unsafe
   jwt.verify(token, process.env.JWT_SECRET!);
   
   // Recommended
   const secret = process.env.JWT_SECRET;
   if (!secret) throw new Error('JWT_SECRET not configured');
   jwt.verify(token, secret);
   \`\`\`

2. **Error Information Leakage** (Medium)
   Generic error messages are good, but consider logging the actual error server-side for debugging.

### 🟡 Suggestions (3)

1. Add token expiration handling with refresh logic
2. Consider rate limiting on auth endpoints
3. Add request ID to error responses for tracing

### 🟢 Positives
- Clean separation of concerns
- Good TypeScript types
- Proper async/await usage
- Tests cover main scenarios

### Overall Score: 8.5/10
